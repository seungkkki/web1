It is classified as a small dog and has mostly small heads. <strong>Chihuahua <u>doesn't put up with it.</u> </strong> You have to be very very careful when you touch them <u>because they have a bad personality.</u><br>

<p style="margin-top:20px;width:800px"> The names of my aunt's puppies are jjong (Danmo Chihuahua, 11 years old) and Kong (Jangmo Chihuahua, 9 years old). Jjong-Jjong has a bright personality, but she is tactless and frustrating people a lot. On the other hand, Kongkong has a timid and quiet personality and has a certain fan base that appeals to her. The picture below shows a puppy that is not related to Jjong and Kong. This photo was chosen with a large additional point of unusual fur color and kinda funny angry face.</p>
